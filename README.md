# sonofanton

This repository exists.

No guarantees are made.

Decisions are made under constraint.

---

Son of Anton is not a moderation system, validator, or classifier.

It is a constraint-aware decision ledger.

Its purpose is to:

- make decisions only under explicitly declared constraints
- record those decisions as immutable artifacts
- expose the current state without explanation, persuasion, or promise

It does not decide what is true.

It records that a decision was made, under which constraints, and by what authority.

The public surface (“witness”) exists so observers can see:

- whether the system is active or degraded
- what constraints were acknowledged
- when the last decision occurred

Nothing more.

If context is missing, the system does not infer intent — it degrades visibly.

If constraints are absent, absence itself becomes a constraint and is logged.

In short:

Son of Anton exists to make it impossible to pretend a decision was unconstrained.
